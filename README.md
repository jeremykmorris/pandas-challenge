# pandas-challenge
Xpert Learning Assistant was used for help throughout most of the code.
One section of code that Instructor Grant Smith helped me with the per_school_summary Dataframe since i kept encounting an error stating that the data must be 1-demensional and grant walked me through during office hours how to solve it by taking a look back at the calculation of the variables previous to see which one was causing the dataframe be multi-dimensional. Grant also took a look at some of my code and noticed a typo I made near the top when I combined the data into a single dataset.
